            <h1>How to Play</h1>
            <p><b>!!! To play, please open your browser console !!!</b></p>
            <h2>Objective</h2>
            <p>
                Have lowest total card value in your hand, at the end of the game. See table above for values per card.<br/>
            </p>
            <h2>Deal</h2>
            <p>
                Each player is dealt 4 unrevealed cards split into two rows, face-down in front of them.<br/>
                The remaining deck is placed faced down in the middle of the table, with adjacent space for a discard pile.
            </p>
            <h2>Opening</h2>
            <p>
                All players can pick up and look at their nearest two cards, and then place them back down again.<br/>
                <i>Hint: You should try to memorise these cards and in which position they lie once placed back on the
                    table.</i><br/>
                Once all players have put their cards back down and ready to begin, the dealer will turn the first card over and
                place it face up to initiate the discard pile.<br/>
                Now players commence their turns.
            </p>
            <h2>For each turn</h2>
            <p>
                The player must pick up either the top card from either the discard pile or the faced-down deck. The player can
                choose to either keep the card, or throw it away.<br/>
                By keeping the card, the player must swap it for any one of their own cards, placing the replaced card face up
                in the discard pile.<br/>
                <i>Hint: Remember the objective is to collect the lowest total value, so you want to replace your high-value
                    cards with low-value cards</i><br/>
                If the player picked up a 7,8,9,10,J,Q, or <b>Black</b> K from the deck and immediately discards it, they can do
                a special move.
            </p>
            <h3>7 or 8 Look at own</h3>
            <p>
                The player may look at one of their own cards briefly before putting it back in the same place.
            </p>
            <h3>9 or 10 Look at theirs</h3>
            <p>
                The player may look at one of someone else's cards briefly before putting it back in the same place.
            </p>
            <h3>Jack or Queen</h3>
            <p>
                The player can blind-swap one of their cards for someone else's.
            </p>
            <h3><b>Black</b> King</h3>
            <p>
                The player can look at one of their cards, and one of someone else's, and then choose to swap.
            </p>
            <h2>In between turns</h2>
            <p>
                There are actions players can take at any time even when it isn't their turn.<br/>
            </p>
            <h3>Slam own</h3>
            <p>
                If a card is discarded, and a player thinks one of their cards has the same number or face, they may "slam"
                their card.<br/>
                This means taking that card and placing it face-up on the discard pile. However, once a slam has taken place,
                their can be no further slams until different card is discarded.<br/>
                The player who successfully slammed first now has one less card to count at the end of the game<br/>
                If the player slams a card which doesn't match the number or face of the previous card, they must take their
                card back and be dealt another card faced-down to their collection.
            </p>
            <h3>Slam theirs</h3>
            <p>
                ... Similarly, if a player thinks an opponent's card matches the face or value of the last-discarded card, they
                may try to slam that card.<br/>
                Again, if they get it wrong, the mistaken card is replaced, and the offender must collect a new card for their
                own collection.
            </p>
            <h3>Endgame</h3>
            <p>
                When a player believes they have a winning hand, instead of picking up a card on their turn, they call "Cabo".
                Their cards are locked and no-one can touch them.<br/>
                The remaining players each take a final turn (but cannot call "Cabo" themselves).<br/>
                Once the final player has had their turn, all the cards are revealed.<br/>
                The winner is the player with the lowest total card value. The winner gets first turn in the next round.
            </p>
            <h2>Tie-breakers</h2>
            <p>
                If there is a draw, the player with the least total number of cards winds.<br/>
                If there is still a draw, then the person who called "Cabo" <b>loses</b> and the other player wins.
                If there is still a draw and neither of the players called "Cabo", then the game remains a draw.
